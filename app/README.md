## Notes

- I have no design skills that is why the app looks like that
- [the master branch](https://github.com/ifrim/re-vue/tree/master/app) uses vue-cli, vue itself with all its concepts (mostly), vue-router
- [the vuex branch](https://github.com/ifrim/re-vue/tree/vuex/app) introduces vuex for state management, replacing the vanilla js state management from before
- [the material branch](https://github.com/ifrim/re-vue/tree/material/app) introduces vue-material to build the "create event" form
